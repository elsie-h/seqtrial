<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A package for performing the sequential trial approach to target trial
emulation using observational data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of seqtrial like so:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("elsie-h/seqtrial")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
